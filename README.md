Here you'll find renderers, game engines, and games. I do other things too, but they're not here yet.

### Featured Projects

Currently, my main personal project is [ivy](https://github.com/bouncyphoton/ivy) which is my Vulkan framework/toy game engine. Also here is [acorn](https://github.com/bouncyphoton/acorn) which was my previous framework/toy game engine and [maple](https://github.com/bouncyphoton/maple) which was my first attempt at a compute shader path tracer.
